This is a self-build starter that can work with both webpack and express - nodemon for hot reloadiing. There is no dev server on this webpack.

To run this, do:
npm install

afther that we need to run webpack --watch on one terminal and running nodemon on another terminal. Both are written inside the script so they can run from npm. Now you can see new page by reloading it after changing the code.

This is only a temporary solution. My goal is a hot reload combination of webpack and express.
