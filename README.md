This is a self-build starter that can work with both webpack and express - nodemon for hot reloadiing. THere are no dev server on this webpack.
To do this, we need to run webpack --watch on one terminal and running nodemon on another terminal. Both are written inside the script so they can run from npm. You can check the result 
by reloading it.

This is only a temporary solution. 

My goal a hot reload combination of webpack and express.
